## Validation Testing and Documentation
Tests for button functionality, Tamagotchi growth stages, and error handling.



## 1. Functional Testing
This involves testing the functions of the Tamagotchi application to ensure they behave as expected.

The data structure and content:
- **Test Case ID**
- **Description**
- **Steps**
- **Expected Result**
- **Actual Result**
- **Status (Pass/Fail)**

> This document [Download the Excel file](#) outlines the style for validation testing and provides a test case template to efficiently track testing activities.

### Test Cases:

**TC1: Tamagotchi Growth**
- **Objective:** Ensure the Tamagotchi progresses through its life stages correctly.
- **Steps:** Initialize the application, simulate the passage of time or actions to increase age, and observe the stage transitions from Egg to Child to Adult.
- **Expected Result:** The Tamagotchiâ€™s stage should update at the defined ages (5 for Child, 10 for Adult).

**TC2: Feeding Mechanism**
- **Objective:** Validate that feeding decreases hunger.
- **Steps:** Note the initial hunger level, click the feed button, and check the hunger level again.
- **Expected Result:** Hunger level should decrease by 1 with each feed action, not dropping below 0.

**TC3: Health and Sickness**
- **Objective:** Test that the health management and sickness features work.
- **Steps:** Induce sickness by using the `random_events` method or a button if implemented. Administer medicine and check health improvement.
- **Expected Result:** If sick, the health should improve by 1 and the sickness status should clear after administering medicine.

**TC4: Happiness and Play**
- **Objective:** Ensure that playing with the Tamagotchi increases happiness.
- **Steps:** Check the initial happiness, use the play function or a corresponding button, and recheck the happiness level.
- **Expected Result:** Happiness should increase by 1 with each play action, not exceeding 10.

**TC5: Discipline**
- **Objective:** Check if the discipline functionality works as expected.
- **Steps:** Observe the initial discipline level, apply discipline, and check the level again.
- **Expected Result:** Discipline level should increase by 1 with each action, not exceeding 10.

**TC6: Toilet Needs**
- **Objective:** Ensure that the toilet needs and flushing system functions.
- **Steps:** Manually set `needs_toilet` to True, use the flush function, and check the status.
- **Expected Result:** `needs_toilet` should become False after the flush.

## 2. Interface Testing
Test the GUI elements for functionality and to ensure they are displaying the correct information.

### Test Cases:

**TC7: GUI Updates**
- **Objective:** Validate that all GUI labels update correctly when actions are taken.
- **Steps:** Perform actions like feeding or playing and observe the changes in the GUI labels for hunger, happiness, and health.
- **Expected Result:** All labels should reflect the current status of the Tamagotchi correctly after any action.

**TC8: Button Functionality**
- **Objective:** Ensure all buttons trigger their respective functions.
- **Steps:** Click each button in the application and observe the expected action.
- **Expected Result:** Each button should perform its defined function without errors.

### 3. Error Handling
Test how the application handles unexpected user input or actions.

#### Test Cases:

**TC9: Overfeeding**
- **Objective:** Confirm the application handles overfeeding without crashing or errors.
- **Steps:** Attempt to feed the Tamagotchi when hunger is at 0.
- **Expected Result:** Application should not allow hunger to go below 0 and should handle the action gracefully, possibly with a message or no change in the hunger level.

**TC10: Excessive Playing**
- **Objective:** Check the handling of continuous play actions when happiness is maxed out.
- **Steps:** Max out the happiness level and attempt to increase it further.
- **Expected Result:** Happiness should not exceed 10, and the system should handle it appropriately.
